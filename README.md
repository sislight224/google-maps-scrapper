## ü§î FAQs

### ‚ùì The scraper is only retrieving 5 results. How can I scrape all Google Maps search results?
A: Open the file `src/config.py` and comment out the line that sets the `max_results` parameter. 

By doing so, you can scrape all the search results from Google Maps. For example, to scrape all restaurants in Delhi, modify the code as follows:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
        # "max_results" : 5,
    },
]
```
Note: You will be able to scrape up to 120 leads per search due to Google's scrolling limitation. 

### ‚ùì I want to scrape search results for a specific search query. How can I achieve that?
A: Open the file `src/config.py` and update the `keyword` with your desired search query. 

For example, if you want to scrape data about stupas in Kathmandu üá≥üáµ, modify the code as follows:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "stupas in kathmandu",
    },
]
```


### ‚ùì How can I filter google map search results?

A: You have the option to apply filters to your Google Maps search results using the following parameters:

1. min_rating
2. min_reviews
3. max_reviews
4. has_phone
5. has_website


To specify filters, open `src/config.py` and specify your filters. 

The Following example will scrape only those listings with a minimum of 5 reviews, a maximum of 100 reviews, and a phone number.

```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
        "min_reviews": 5 ,
        "max_reviews": 100,
        "has_phone": True,
    },
]
```


### ‚ùì How to sort by reviews, rating, or title?

To sort your results by reviews, rating, or title, follow these steps:

Open the file `src/config.py` and set the `sort` key. 

For example, to sort by reviews in descending order, modify the code as follows:

```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "stupas in kathmandu",
        "sort": {
            "by": "reviews",
            "order": "desc",
        },
    },
]
```

You can sort by any field, such as `reviews`, `main_category`, `title`, `rating`, or any other field. Here are some common sort examples:

1. Sort by `reviews` count in descending order:
```python
        "sort": {
            "by": "reviews",
            "order": "desc",
        },
```

2. Sort by `main_category` in ascending order:
```python
        "sort": {
            "by": "main_category",
            "order": "asc",
        },
```

3. Sort by `title` in ascending order:
```python
        "sort": {
            "by": "title",
            "order": "asc",
        },
```

4. Sort by `rating` in descending order:
```python
        "sort": {
            "by": "rating",
            "order": "desc",
        },
```

### ‚ùì How to select specific Fields?
If you want to select specific fields to be output in your CSV and JSON files, you can do so by following these steps:

1.  Open `src/config.py`.
2.  Modify the `select` key to include the fields you want to select.

For example, if you want to select "title", "link", "main_category", "rating", "reviews", "website", "phone", and "address", you should adjust the code as follows:

```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "stupas in kathmandu",
        "select": ["title", "link", "main_category", "rating", "reviews",  "website", "phone" , "address"],
    },
]
```

You are free to select any field. Here are a couple of common field selections:

1. Standard field selection:
```python
        "select": ["title", "link", "main_category", "rating", "reviews",  "website", "phone" , "address"],
```

2. Selection of all fields (Default):
```python
        "select": "ALL",
```


### ‚ùì How to increase the speed of the Scraper?

To boost the scraping speed, the scraper launches multiple browsers simultaneously. Here's how you can increase the speed furthur:

- Adjust the `number_of_scrapers` variable in the configuration file. Recommended values are:
  - Standard laptop: 4 or 8
  - Powerful laptop: 12 or 16

Note: Avoid setting `number_of_scrapers` above 16, as Google Maps typically returns only 120 results. Using more than 16 scrapers may lead to a longer time spent on launching the scrapers than on scraping the places. Hence, it is best to stick to 4, 8, 12, or 16.

In case you encounter any issues, like the scraper crashing due to low-end PC specifications, follow these recommendations:

- Reduce the `number_of_scrapers` by 4 points.
- Ensure you have sufficient storage (at least 4 GB) available, as running multiple browser instances consumes storage space.
- Close other applications on your computer to free up memory.

Additionally, consider improving your internet speed to further enhance the scraping process.


### ‚ùì Can I scrape more than one query using this script?
A: Absolutely! Open `src/config.py` and add as many queries as you like. 

For example, if you want to scrape restaurants in both Delhi üòé and Bangalore üë®‚Äçüíª, use the following code:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
    },
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in bangalore",
    }
]
```


### ‚ùì How to scrape emails and social links like Twitter and Facebook of Shop Owners?

Google Maps does not display the emails and social links of shop owners. However, it does show the owner's Google profile, which we scrape and store in the `owner` field as shown below:

```json
        "owner": {
            "id": "102395794819517641473",
            "link": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102395794819517641473",
            "name": "38 Barracks Restaurant and Bar (Owner)"
        },
```

To obtain the shop owner's emails and social links, you have two options:

1. Visit the website of each shop and manually find the contact details.
2. Use the Contact Details Scraper by vdrmota, available [here](https://www.omkar.cloud/l/contact-info-scraper/), to automatically scrape the contact details.

If you are using the Google Maps Scraper for prospecting and selling your products or services, it is recommended to manually visit the first 100 lead's websites. This will provide you with a better understanding of your prospects. Also, the task of finding contact details from 100 websites, can be done within 2 hours if you work with focus and speed.

Once you have validated the success of your Google Maps scraper strategy, you can scale up your efforts using the [Contact Details Scraper](https://www.omkar.cloud/l/contact-info-scraper/), which is also quite affordable.


### ‚ùì How much time does it take to scrape "n" searches?

On average, each Google Maps search gives 120 listings. It takes approximately 2.5 minutes to scrape these 120 listings.

To calculate the number of **hours** it takes to scrape "n" searches, you can **google search** this formula substituting `n` with number of searches you want to conduct:

`n * 2.5 minutes`

For example, if you want to scrape 10 google map queries or 1200 listings, it will take around 25m.

### ‚ùì How to Run it in Docker?

1. Run the following command to build Docker Image:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```
2. Run the following command to start the Conatiner:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

The scraped data will be stored in the `output` folder. If you make changes to `config.py` like changing search query, please repeat steps 1 and 2.

### ‚ùì How can I utilize the data obtained from Google Maps?
A: Most people scrape Google Maps Listings to sell things!

For example, you can search for restaurants in Amritsar and pitch your web development services to them.

You can also find real estate listings in Delhi and promote your exceptional real estate software.

Google Maps is seriously a great platform to find B2B customers to sell things to!
